Hello!

The report is in this folder, and when checking files, please refer to files found in minilab2_working, not the non-working version. These files are largely the same but I made a few small modifications so the files found under Verilog and minilab2_kindofworking may not reflect the demo'd version of the project.

Testbenches of course are found under testbenches along with one of the two python files for image conversion (though I believe it is old. The correct ones are on my desktop so can be provided upon request along with the test images I used.

Please email me if you have any questions or concerns! 

Email: henryjwg@gmail.com or hwysonggrass@wisc.edu and put [554] in the subject line.

Cheers,
Henry
